# credit-score-project
This project analyzes and predicts credit scores using machine learning models.  
The dataset includes features such as Age, Gender, Education, Marital Status, Income, and more.  

## Steps in the Project
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering (encoding + scaling)  
4. Train-test split  
5. Logistic Regression and Random Forest models  
6. Model evaluation (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)  
7. Feature importance visualization  

## Requirements
See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for all dependencies.

## How to Run
1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
